			<h1 id="header"> Tools </h1>
			<p> The first tool I used was Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) which is used to create web pages.  The basic headings, text, images, links, tables and more are done with HTML through the use of tags.  HTML is like the backbone of a web page. </p>
			<p> The next tool I used was Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).  This is used to style web pages.  It can be written directly into the HTML document or as a CSS file that is later added in.  I chose to write it as a CSS file because it allows the navigational panel and the headers to be of the same format with less writing.  Every element can be style through their tag name, id name or class name.  This is where you can change the font, color, position, etc.  You can make pretty much any style change with a CSS file. </p>
			<p> The last tool I used was JavaScript (JS).  JS is used to make web pages interactive.  Like CSS, JS can be written into the HTML document or as a JS file.  I chose to write it into the HTML document because it is easier to place the JS as the end and not have to worry about functions not loading in correctly.  This is where I took the data from the input and placed it into the table.  Pretty much anything that could be clicked on included some JS. </p>
